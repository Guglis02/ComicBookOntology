# Comic Book Ontology
A metadata vocabulary for describing comic books and comic book collections.

## Abstract
The Comic Book Ontology is a metadata vocabulary for describing comic books and comic book collections. It is a work in progress and part of a larger research project exploring the organization and description of data about comic books.

## Status
The current version of the Ontology (v0.13.1), reflects the research, contents, and discussion found in the thesis project that produced it. Starting with the next, post-thesis version (v0.14), the Ontology will be open to suggestions, input, contributions, etc. New licensing options are being explored.
